        <h2>Life.</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my life, I’ve lived in many different countries. I was born
          in South Korea, but I moved to California with my family when I was
          about five years old. After two years or so, we moved back again
          to South Korea, in Gyeonggi-do Province, just outside Seoul. When I
          turned eleven (and just when we were getting comfortable), we once
          again moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which I can proudly call it my
          second home. We stayed in Malaysia for more than seven years, and
          fortunately, that was just long enough for me to complete my secondary
          education with an IB diploma. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the fall of 2014, I moved to Iowa to study at Grinnell College.
          Interestingly, I actually spent my freshmen year as a Bio/Chem major
          since that was what I initially hoped to major in when I first came to
          the U.S. After completing the first year, I went back to South Korea
          to serve in the military for 21 months. That was when I got interested
          in programming. Instead of immediately returning to college, I took a
          year off to explore the world of computers and computational sciences.
          For the first six months, I studied programming languages like Python
          and HTML/CSS/JS as well as algorithms and data structures from online
          courses. I then spent the next six months working for a small
          blockchain startup company to immerse myself into the tech industry
          and gained invaluable experiences.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          As I returned to Grinnell College in the fall of 2018, I soon declared
          my major in computer science. My passion for computer science and
          programming has deepened over the years as I continue to polish my
          skills and attain new experiences. Some of the specific fields that
          I'm currently interested in are: autonomous driving, finance-data
          analytics, medical AI, and bioinformatics.
